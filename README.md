## Description
I converted my commonly used engineering calculation from excel into an online toolbox. It contains a number of tools for calculating fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and other various engineering problems. I decided to make this website soley with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to challenge my understanding of the basics. In the end, I used a small amount of JQuery to make the navbar appear on every page.

## Technologies
- HTML
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSSJQuery

## My Role
I developed and hosted this site on my own.

## Features
- Ten commonly used process engineering calculators
